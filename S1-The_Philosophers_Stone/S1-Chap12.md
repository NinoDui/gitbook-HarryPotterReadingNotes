### Expressions

One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow.

While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the draughty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind **rattled the windows** in the classrooms.

Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.

'**Be that as it may**, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,' said Snape silkily.

The Hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls and no fewer than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.

They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid had **let it slip**, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal?

Wishing he'd been **a bit quicker at thinking up some story**, Harry left the library.

What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Price breathing down their necks.

Excitement **flooded** through him as he stood there in the dark and silence.

The hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.

There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry **looked over his shoulder** - but, still, no one was there.

The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.

Harry felt **as though his insides had turned to ice**.

'Yes and no, ' said Dumbledore quietly. '**It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. ... However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.**'

'**It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.**'
