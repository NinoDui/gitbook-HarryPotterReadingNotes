### Expressions

All the revision he had to do **kept his mind off his mistery**.

Then, about a week before the exams were **due to start**, Harry's new resolution not interfere in anything that didn't concern him was **put to an unexpected test**.

The moon was bright, but clouds scudded across it kept throwing them into darkness.

Then a pain pierced his head like he'd never felt before, it was as though his scar was on fire - half-blinded, he staggered backwards. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over him, charging at the figure.

'Do you not see that unicorn?' Firenze bellowed at Bane. 'Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not **let you in on that secret**? I set myself against what is lurking in this Forest, Bane, yes, **with humans alongside me if I must**.'

'Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenceless to save yourself and you will have but a half life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood toucheds your lips.'
