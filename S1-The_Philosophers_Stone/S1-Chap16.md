### Expressions

In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet **the days crept by** and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.

Harry nodded, but he couldn't **shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important.**

'Look,' said Harry, **throwing caution to the winds**, 'Professor - it's about the Philosopher's Stone - '

'You want to be more careful,' said Snape. 'Hanging around like this, people will think you're **up to something**. And Gryffindor really can't afford to lose any more points, can they?'

Neville's **arms snapped to his sides**. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.

Slowly, the dog's growls ceased - it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.

The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.
