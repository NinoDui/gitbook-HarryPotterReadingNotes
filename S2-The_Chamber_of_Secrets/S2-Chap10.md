### Expressions

**Chest heaving with emotion**, Wood turned to Harry.

The Slytherins' superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs, and meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock Harry out of the air.

'You should have come straight to me !' she raged, holding up the sad, limp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been a working arm.

Dobby's lip trembled and Harry **was seized by a sudden suspicion**.

A jet of steam had hissed out of the camera. Harry, three beds away, caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic.

And **from what Harry could see of Professor McGonagall's shadowy face**, she didn't understand this **any better than he did**.
