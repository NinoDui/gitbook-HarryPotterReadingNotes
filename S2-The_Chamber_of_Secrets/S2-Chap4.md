### Expressions

The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys' house burst with the strange and unexpected.

'What're you all **up to** today?'

Five minutes later they were marching up the hill, **broomsticks over their shoulders**. 啊啊啊超有画面感啊好暖！

It felt as though he was being sucked down a giant plug hole. He seemed to be **spinning** very fast ... the roaring in his ears was deafening ...he tried to keep his eyes open but the **whirl** of green flames made him feel sick ... something hard knocked his elbow and he **tucked** it in tightly, still spinning and spinning ... now it felt as though cod hands were slapping his face ... **squinting** through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and **snatched** glimpses of the rooms beyond ... his bacon sandwiches were **churning** inside him ...

Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet **to his left**; he shot inside it and pulled the doors to, leaving a small crack to peer through.

Harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away.

Clutching his broken glasses to his face he stared around. 倒装

Her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight.

She ran down to meet them, her bushy brown hair flying behind her.

Mrs Weasley now **came galloping into view**, her handbag swinging wildly in one hand, Ginny just clinging onto the other.

'You e careful, Arthur,' said Mrs Weasley sharply, as they were ushered into he bank by a bowing goblin at the door. 'That family's trouble, don't go **biting off more than you can chew**.'

He tried to **block the contents from view** as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag.

They were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop.

Then he **leapt to his feet** and positively shouted, 'It can't be Harry Potter?'

'Bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter?' said a voice Harry **had no trouble recognizing**. He straightened up and **found himself face to face** with Draco Malfoy, who was **wearing his usual sneer**.

'Obviously not,' he said. 'Dear me, what's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it?'

There was a **thud** of metal as Ginny's cauldron went flying; Mr Weasley had **thrown himself at** Mr Malfoy, knocking him backwards into a bookshelf.
