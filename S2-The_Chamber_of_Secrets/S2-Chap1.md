### Expressions

The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth; Mr Dursley jumped to his feet, **veins throbbing in his temples**.

Harry looked up, **hardly daring to believe it**.

But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so **cut off** from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had **lost its appeal**.

Harry had **slipped through Voldemort's clutches** for a second time, but it had been a **narrow escape**, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the night, **drenched in cold sweat**, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes ...

'What?' said Harry, **not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been**.

While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice-creams, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, **mowed** the lawn, **trimmed** the flowerbeds, **pruned** and **watered** the roses and repainted the garden bench.
