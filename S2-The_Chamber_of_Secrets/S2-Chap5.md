### Expressions

She and Ginny got into the front seat, which had been **stretched so that is resembled a park bench**.

Ron's trunk fell off with a loud thump, Harry was knocked off his feet, and Hedwig's cage bounced onto the shiny floor and she rolled away, shrieking indignantly.

Harry stuck his head out of the window: **traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead**, but their street was empty.

The ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away, **dropping out of sight as the car rose**; in seconds, the whole of London lay, smoky and glittering, below them.

**It was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream.**

They made **regular** checks on the train as they flew further and further north, each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view. London was soon far behind them, **replaced by** neat green fields **which gave way in turn to** wide, purplish moors, villages with tiny toy churches and a great city alive with cars like multi-colored ants.

'Can't be much further, can it?' croaked Ron, hours later still, as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud, **staining it a deep pink**.

Silhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over the lake, stood the many turrets and towers of Hogwarts castle.

It had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling limply, held on by a few splinters.

Then, **dented, scratched and steaming**, the car rumbled off into the darkness, its rear lights blazing angrily.

But the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust.

Innumberable candles were hovering in the mid-air over four long, crowded tables, **making the golden plates and goblets sparkle**. Overhead, the bewitched ceiling which always mirrored the sky outside, sparkled with stars.

There, his black robes rippling in a cold breeze, stood Severus Snape.

Harry had seen Professor McGonagall angry on several occasions, but **either he had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen her this angry before**.

They walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs, until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to Gryffindor Tower **was hidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress**.
