### Expressions

There was **a silence broken only by the clink of knives and forks from downstairs** and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon's voice.

Mouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him, trying not to make a sound.

Uncle Vernon was **as bad as his word**.

Yet life at Privet Drive had reached an all-time low.

Dobby might have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but **the way things were going**, e'd probably starve to death anyway.

Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp.

Exhausted, stomach rumbling, mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions, Harry fell into an uneasy sleep.
