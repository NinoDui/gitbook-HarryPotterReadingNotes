### Expressions

Attached no doubt by Malfoy's shout, Argus Filch **came shouldering his way through the crowd**. Then he saw Mrs Norris and fell back, **clutching his face in horror**.

Much as he detested Filch, Harry couldn't help feeling a bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as he felt for himself.

'Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time,' he said, a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it, 'but we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here...'

'**Innocent until proven guilty**, Severus,' he said firmly.

Professor Binns opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally coming round long enough to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep again.

'People here will believe anything,' said Ron in disgust.
