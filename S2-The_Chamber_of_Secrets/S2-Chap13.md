Hermione left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail-less and fur-free, at the beginning of February.

And while Harry was sure he had never heard the name T.M.Riddle before, it still seemed to mean something to him, almost as though Riddle was a friend he'd had when he was very small, and half-forgotten.

He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly in to focus.
