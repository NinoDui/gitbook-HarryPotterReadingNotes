### Expressions

Summer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses.

The sight seemed to **stiffen his resolve**, and he nodded.

The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days, because from sis o'clock **onwards**, the Gryffindors had nowhere else to go.

His mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping.

His heart seemed to **have left his chest to pound in his throat**.
