### Expressions

**October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle.**

In spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face.

A faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place.

Harry was just reading 'Lesson One: Holding Your Wand (Some Useful Tips)' when shuffling footsteps outside told him Filch was coming back.

Harry braced himself for a tidal wave of fury.

The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular display of tangerine starts showering from the Salamander's mouth, and its escape into the fire, **with accompanying explosions**, drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from Harry's mind.

The assembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap too, but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick's face.

His stomach lurched. 'It's going to kill someone!' he shouted, and ignoring Ron and Hermione's bewildered faces, **he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time**, trying to listen over is own pounding footsteps.

A rumble, as though of distant thunder, old them that the feast had just ended. From either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the passage from both ends.

He had pushed to the front of the crowd, **his cold eyes alive, his usually bloodless face flushed**, as he grinned at the sight of the hanging, immobile cat.
