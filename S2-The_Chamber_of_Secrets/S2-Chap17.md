### Expressions

Towering stone pillars entwined with more carved serpents **rose to support a ceiling** lost in darkness, casting long black shadows through the odd, greenish gloom that filled the place.

Ginny's head lolled hopelessly from side to side.

Riddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn't suit him. It made the hairs stand up on the back of Harry's neck.

Harry's fists were clenched, the nails digging deep into his palms.

You think I was going to use my filthy Muggle father's name for ever? I, in whose veins runs the blood of Salazar Slytherin himself, through my mother's side? I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle, who abandoned me even before I was born, just because he found out his wife was a witch?

He was speaking at random, wanting to scare Riddle, **wishing rather than believing it to be true**.

For a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still raised, stared at it. Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to do it all along, Harry seized the Basilisk fang on the floor next to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book.
