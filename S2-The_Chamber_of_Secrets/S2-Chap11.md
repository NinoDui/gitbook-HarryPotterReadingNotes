### Expressions

Harry woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory **blazing with winter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff**.

'You wish,' said Harry **out of the corner of his mouth**.

Harry felt the fear drain out of him.

Resisting the urge to take a look, Harry walked on by, thinking that Justin might be using his free lesson to catch up on some work, and deciding to check the library first.

He was walking towards them when something of what they were saying **met his ears**, and he paused to listen, hidden in the Invisibility section.

I mean to say, if Potter's marked him down as his next victim, it's best if he **keeps a low profile** for a while.

Harry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow, his heart doing a kind of drum-roll against his ribs.
